# Class Project

### Codergram

This is just a code reference, note if you clone and try to go on with this version it will probably not work because of issues with the migration files.

##### Instructions

0. If you have less than 5 repos in your Github, add more of your projects
1. Make the link to follow look different depending on if that relationship already exists (if the current_user is already following the user who made that post then it should say ‘Unfollow’
2. Implement the liking functionality from the socialization gem
3. Fix up the appearance to look more like instagram
